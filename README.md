Contact Management System
A contact management system is a software program that enables users to easily store and find contact information, such as names, addresses and telephone numbers. They are contact-centric databases that provide a fully integrated approach to tracking of all information and communication activities linked to contacts.

•	Centralized repository of contact information
•	Ready to use database with searching
•	Sales tracking
•	Email integration
•	Scheduling of appointments and meetings
•	Document management
•	Notes and conversation management
•	Customizable fields
